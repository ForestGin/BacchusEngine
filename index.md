## BacchusEngine

Welcome to our Particle subsystem showcase website made by Pol Bosch & Oscar Larios.

The particles subsystem allows the creation of particle effects with textures.

### Particle System Funcionalities
Bacchus Engine has the integration of a particle subsystem that allows the user to create particles at will by modifying 
the particle emitter in the inspector and adding textures to it. Once the particle emitter has been modified, hit play to see
the created particle
